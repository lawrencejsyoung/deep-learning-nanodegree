# Deep Learning Nanodegree

## Project 1: Bikesharing Predictions using Neural Network

In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction 
problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much 
better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important 
to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. You'll also get to see how to 
apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!


## Project 2: Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network

In this project, you'll classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, 
dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional 
neural network on all the samples. You'll normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build 
a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. 
At the end, you'll see their predictions on the sample images.

## Project 3: TV Script Generation using Recurrent Neural Network

In this project, you'll generate your own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part 
of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate 
a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

## Project 4: Language Translation using Sequence2Sequence RNN

In this project, you’re going to take a peek into the realm of neural network machine translation. 
You’ll be training a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that 
can translate new sentences from English to French.

## Project 5: Image Generation using Generative Adversarial Network

In this project, you'll use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.
