## Instructions from Udacity

1. Download the project materials from our GitHub repository. You can either download the repository with
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning.git, or download it as an archive file from this link. 
Our files in the GitHub repo are the most up to date, so it's the best place to get the project files.

2. cd into the first-neural-network directory.

3. Download anaconda or miniconda based on the instructions in the Anaconda lesson.

4. Create a new conda environment:

'''conda create --name dlnd python=3'''

5. Enter your new environment:

	2. Windows: >> activate dlnd

6. Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook installed by doing the following:

'''conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook'''

7. Run the following to open up the notebook:

'''jupyter notebook dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb'''

8. Follow the instructions in the notebook will lead you through the project.
9. Ensure you've passed the unit tests in the notebook before you submit the project!
